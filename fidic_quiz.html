  {
    q: "Which Golden Principle preserves the independence of the Engineer as decision‑maker?",
    options: ["GP1","GP2","GP3","GP4"],
    answer: 0,
    reason: "GP1 states that roles and obligations must remain as set out in the General Conditions, including the Engineer’s impartial role."
  },
  {
    q: "Which GP insists that Particular Conditions must be drafted clearly with no hidden traps?",
    options: ["GP2","GP4","GP5","GP1"],
    answer: 0,
    reason: "GP2 requires that all departures from the General Conditions be clear and unambiguous."
  },
  {
    q: "The maxim \u201Crisk follows control\u201D best describes the aim of which GP?",
    options: ["GP4","GP3","GP2","GP5"],
    answer: 1,
    reason: "GP3 prohibits upsetting the balanced allocation of risk and reward."
  },
  {
    q: "Which GP deals primarily with the reasonableness of time periods in the contract?",
    options: ["GP1","GP4","GP3","GP5"],
    answer: 1,
    reason: "GP4 requires that notice periods, certification times, etc., must stay realistic for the project scale."
  },
  {
    q: "GP5 mandates the use of which dispute‑resolution body before arbitration?",
    options: ["DAAB / DAB","ICC Tribunal","Employer\u2019s Board","Expert Determination"],
    answer: 0,
    reason: "GP5 says disputes must pass through a standing or ad-hoc DAAB first, unless prohibited by law."
  },
  {
    q: "Allowing the Employer to veto an Engineer\u2019s determination would most clearly breach\u2026",
    options: ["GP1","GP2","GP3","GP4"],
    answer: 0,
    reason: "Such a veto changes the Engineer\u2019s role in the General Conditions, violating GP1."
  },
  {
    q: "Cutting the Contractor\u2019s claim-notice period from 28 days to 5 days is likely a breach of\u2026",
    options: ["GP4","GP2","GP3","GP5"],
    answer: 0,
    reason: "Unreasonably short time frames offend GP4."
  },
  {
    q: "Deleting the DAAB clause altogether runs contrary to\u2026",
    options: ["GP5","GP3","GP2","GP1"],
    answer: 0,
    reason: "GP5 requires a DAAB to precede arbitration."
  },
  {
    q: "Hiding a crucial amendment in a technical appendix instead of in Particular Conditions offends\u2026",
    options: ["GP2","GP4","GP1","GP3"],
    answer: 0,
    reason: "GP2 requires clarity and transparency."
  },
  {
    q: "Transferring all unforeseeable ground-condition risk to the Contractor under the Red Book conflicts with\u2026",
    options: ["GP3","GP1","GP4","GP5"],
    answer: 0,
    reason: "Risk misallocation that ignores control violates GP3."
  },
  {
    q: "Extending the Engineer\u2019s payment-certificate time from 28 days to 90 days most threatens\u2026",
    options: ["GP4","GP2","GP3","GP5"],
    answer: 0,
    reason: "Excessively long certification periods can strangle cash-flow and breach GP4\u2019s reasonableness test."
  },
  {
    q: "Failing to mark changes in the PCs and burying them in emailed clarifications mainly breaches\u2026",
    options: ["GP2","GP1","GP5","GP4"],
    answer: 0,
    reason: "GP2 demands transparent and unambiguous presentation of changes."
  },
  {
    q: "Selecting the wrong FIDIC form and then rewriting it to fit your project is often a warning sign for breaking\u2026",
    options: ["GP3","GP1","GP2","GP4"],
    answer: 0,
    reason: "Picking the wrong book usually leads to risk-allocation tweaks that violate GP3."
  },
  {
    q: "True or False: GP1 allows the Employer to take over the Engineer\u2019s authority provided both parties agree.",
    options: ["True","False","Only with DAAB consent","Only in Silver Book"],
    answer: 1,
    reason: "GP1 is inviolable; reallocating Engineer duties undermines the contractual DNA."
  },
  {
    q: "Which GP is BEST described as the \u2018contractual brand-integrity\u2019 principle?",
    options: ["GP1","GP5","GP2","GP3"],
    answer: 0,
    reason: "GP1 ensures the contract can still be called \u2018FIDIC\u2019 by maintaining the role structure."
  },
  {
    q: "A project deletes standing DAAB but allows ad-hoc appointment after a dispute arises. This partial deletion is a risk to\u2026",
    options: ["GP5","GP4","GP2","GP3"],
    answer: 0,
    reason: "Even an ad-hoc-only board erodes the preventive purpose GP5 intends."
  },
  {
    q: "Reasonable Notice Periods are primarily covered under which clause number in FIDIC 2017 Red Book that GP4 seeks to protect?",
    options: ["20.2","14.7","1.1","13.1"],
    answer: 0,
    reason: "Clause 20.2 sets out the 28-day notice, aligning with GP4."
  },
  {
    q: "In the Golden Principles hierarchy, which GP would be evaluated FIRST by a tribunal when assessing a hidden amendment that shifts risk?",
    options: ["GP2","GP3","GP1","GP5"],
    answer: 0,
    reason: "Tribunals establish clarity (GP2) before content (GP3)."
  },
  {
    q: "Which of the following best summarises GP5\u2019s economic rationale?",
    options: ["Early expert decision cheaper than arbitration","Time bars must be fair","Engineer must be independent","Risk follows reward"],
    answer: 0,
    reason: "DAAB delivers quicker, cheaper dispute avoidance."
  },
  {
    q: "If an Employer instructs the Engineer to certify 110% of actual work to help Contractor cashflow, which GP is indirectly at risk?",
    options: ["GP1","GP4","GP2","GP3"],
    answer: 0,
    reason: "Engineer\u2019s independence could be compromised, engaging GP1."
